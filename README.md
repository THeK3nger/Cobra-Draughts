# CobraDraughts

## What is it?

**Cobra Draughts** is a lightweight AI for draught/checkers game. The main goal
of this software is to provide a simple engine for *AI vs. AI* match for Machine
Learning purpose.

However it's perfectly suitable for *AI vs. Human* match.

## Known Issues

Cobra Draughts is not complete yet. I have written a list of know issues and 
missing features that I want to solve quickly.

1. The "chain-capture" is not legal yet. It is the biggest issue.
2. There is no way to ask move to user.
3. There is no practical way to handle match move and result.
